# Expose Your Apex Class as a Web Service
You can expose your Apex class methods as a REST or SOAP web service operation. 
By making your methods callable through the web, your external applications can integrate with Salesforce to perform all sorts of nifty operations.

For example, say your companyâ€™s call center is using an internal application to manage on-premises resources. 
Customer support representatives are expected to use the same application to perform their daily work, including managing case records in Salesforce. 
By using one interface, representatives can view and update case records and access internal resources. 
The application calls an Apex web service class to manage Salesforce case records.
