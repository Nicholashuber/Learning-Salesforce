# Rest Service examples.

REST has been preferred for services that are exposed as public APIs.

REST stands for Representational State Transfer;

REST is an architectural style not a protocol.

REST API uses simple HTTP methods using XML or JSON format.

You can define your apex classes as REST Resource by defining the class with @RestResource annotation.

The URL mapping to access the REST service is defined at the class level too.
