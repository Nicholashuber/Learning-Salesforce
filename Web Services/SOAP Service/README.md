# SOAP Service examples

SOAP has been preferred for services within the enterprise


SOAP stands for Simple Object Access protocol.

SOAP messages are in XML format and sent over HTTP.

Defining an Apex method as a SOAP web service is very easy.

The method needs to be placed in a global class and must use the keyword 'webservice'.




External application can call your SOAP web service by using the class WSDL.

WSLD class can be generated by using the WSDL button on the APEX class containing the SOAP web service method.

In SOAP, the link between the client and server is not flexible.

Any change from both sides would break the linkage.
