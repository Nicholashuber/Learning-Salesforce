# Hello World Lightning Component
A simple example showing how to create a lightning component that displays "Hello World"


1) Click on the Setup icon Setup in the upper right-hand corner and choose Developer Console.<br>
2) In the Developer Console, choose File > New > Lightning Component. You'll notice that the resulting dialog says New Lightning Bundle, not component. This is more accurate because an Aura component is a bundle of files.<br>
3) Name the component: HelloWorld<br>
4) Select Lightning Record Page and click Submit.<br>
