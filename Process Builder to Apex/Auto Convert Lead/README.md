# Real World Scenario: How to use Process Builder to leverage Auto Conversion of Leads

<br/><br/>
Something we should always strive to do is remove any possibilities of a user NOT doing something. <br/> 
For instance when converting a lead typically users click a button called "Convert lead" on the lead record to generate an Account, Contact, and Opportunity.
<br/>
Lets automate that!

<br/>
Lets Create a Process Builder: Click Setup → Create → Workflow & Approvals → Process Builder.<br>
Click the New button to create a new Process Builder process, and provide the process name and Description, and then click the Save button.
