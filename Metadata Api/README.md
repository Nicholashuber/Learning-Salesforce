# Metadata Api Examples
Let’s say you have 10 orgs, one for each of the countries/sectors in which you do business.
You use managed packages to update the orgs. 
You’ve created a custom field for Accounts, and you want it to show up on the page layouts in all your orgs.

Who you gonna call? Metadata Api.
